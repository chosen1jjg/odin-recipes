    <h2>It was built on tradition</h2>

    <p>My grandmother always made this cornbread dressing for holiday dinners and for family 
        gatherings at other times of the year. Use your favorite cornbread mix to make a batch
        of cornbread, and then crumble it for use in this family-favorite recipe. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!
