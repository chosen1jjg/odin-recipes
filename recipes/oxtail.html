<h2>"The <em>BEST</em> Southern Oxtail Recipe"</h2>

<p>Being from the South, Oxtails are a luxury and a staple!  This oxtail recipe comes from my
    Mom when she would make smothered Oxtails on Sundays.  Reminds me of a little piece of home.
    Get ready to indulge in a bowl of soul-warming goodness!

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1 pack of Oxtails</li>
    <li>1 onion</li>
    <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>1 cup of beef broth</li>
    <li>1 cup of red wine</li>
    <li>salt, pepper, onion powder, and a touch of paprika</li>
</ul>


<ol>
    <li>First, sear the oxtails until all sides form a nice crust.</li>

    <li>In the same pot, saute the onions and garlic until fragrant.</li>

    <li>Next, pout in red wine to deglaze and then nestle the oxtails back into the pot.</li>

    <li>Pour in beef broth until it partially covers the oxtails. Season with
        salt, pepper, paprika, and your favorite beef seasoning.</li>

    <li>Take the oxtails and place them in the oven allowing them to slow cook
        at 120&deg;F. for about 4 hours.</li>    
        
    <li>Lastly, watch the most tender meat melt in your mouth!</li>
